# mws-walkthrough
This is a walkthrough of the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist (MWS) Nanodegree Restaurant Reviews Projects (Phases 1, 2, and 3)

This walkthrough only covers part of the project.

There is not enough code for the whole project to be completed. The following has to be completed by you:

* Styling and fixing GUI issues on your app
* Implement image lazy loading
* Handling offline maps
* Marking of Restaurant as favorite while offline
* Adding new reviews while offline

The last 2 are the hardest requirements, but if you followed the walkthrough, you'll know enough to complete them on your own.

## How to run on your computer

This walkthrough is live in https://rob4abcba.github.io/mws-walkthrough, but if you want to run on your local machine, simply clone the repo and run it using your favorite local server. For example to run on port `3000` using python you can use:
```
#python3
$ python3 -m http.server 3000

#python2
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```
And now you can access the walkthrough on http://localhost:3000/
