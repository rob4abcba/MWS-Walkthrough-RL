#### _Written Instructions_

You have multiple ways to start a local server. Udacity recommends **python**. 

First, check whether you already have python installed by typing the following at your command terminal prompt:
```
$ python -V
```
Note: It's a capital V not lowercase v.

If not, then install one of the versions of python.

The command to fire off the server depends on which version of python you installed:

##### Python 2.7
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

##### Python 3
```
$ py -m http.server 8000
```

After running the server, you will see your app live at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
