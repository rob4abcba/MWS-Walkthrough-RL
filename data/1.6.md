#### _Overview_

[code example from video](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/stripe-dinosaur)

When it comes to styling our website/apps, the approach I recommend is the mobile first approach.  Design from the smallest to the largest viewport our app will support. Design our app for mobile devices, then add breakpoints for medium and large devices.

```css
/* First styles are for smaller devices with less than 600px of width */
body {
  background: red;
}

/* This applies to devices with a viewport between 600px and 1023px */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background: green;
  }
}

/* This applies to devices with a viewport >= 1024px */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    background: blue;
  }
}
```

##### Media queries in you link elements

In this walkthrough, we use media queries in our `<link>` elements instead of the usual `@media` in a single css file. This will make it easy to manage our styles and a lot easier to find the file to change a given style.

###### Example

To add two breakpoints, so that we have three designs:

* `style.css` for devices between 0px - 599px.
* `style-medium.css` for medium devices between 600px - 1023px.
* `style-large.css` for larger devices.

In the `html` file, load our styles as follows:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 600px)" href="css/styles-medium.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1024px)" href="css/styles-large.css">
```

> It is up to you to decide how many css breakpoints you want to add. You can use one file for small to medium devices and another for larger ones. Just remember to make the design responsive.
